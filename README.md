# AutoBotWA Landing Page

This project is a responsive landing page created for the AutoBotWA Frontend Internship assignment. The goal of the task was to build a clean and mobile-friendly single-page layout using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel v0.

The page includes all the required sections:
- Hero section  
- Features  
- Testimonials  
- Pricing  
- Contact form  
- Footer  

## 💡 Tech Stack

- Next.js – for app structure  
- Tailwind CSS – for styling  
- Vercel v0 – used to generate a starter pricing layout which I later customized  

## 📌 Vercel v0 Usage Notes

- I used Vercel v0 to generate an initial pricing section layout.  
- I reviewed the layout, modified it, and integrated it into the project manually.  
- The v0 output helped with spacing, component grouping, and card structure ideas.  
- The final version is fully customized to match the assignment requirements.
